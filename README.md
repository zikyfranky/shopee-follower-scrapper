# Steps to follow to run on your PC

## Step 1

Make sure python is installed on your PC else go to [Python.Org](python.org) and download Python3

## Step 2

If Python is installed on your PC, open terminal or command prompt and navigate to this folder, then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, this is required to be able to run the crawler as this will install dependencies.

## Step 3

Finally, run `python main.py`

Just leave the console on, when it's done, you should see a followers.txt file, each line containing a link to user profile.
